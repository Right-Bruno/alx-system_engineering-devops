	*SHELL, INIT FILES, VAR AND EXPANSIONS*
# in this project I am learning the concept of the initiation files
# variables and the expansions in the shell. I am increasing my 
# technical skill of being an ethical software engineer through ALX
# program. Let's start.
1. At first we create a file that can create an alias for removing files
2. Second we create a file that greats the current user
3. we also updated the variable path to contain action file
4. We print number of directories in the PATH variable
5. we also print the environmental variables
6. we also printed the all variables and functions
7. Creating a first local variable was awesome
